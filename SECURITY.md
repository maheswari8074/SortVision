# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

At SortVision, we take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### 📝 Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/alienx5499/SortVision/security) of the repository
3. Click on "Report a vulnerability" to start a private discussion
4. Include the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Proof of concept if possible
   - Impact of the issue
   - Suggested fix (if any)

For more information on reporting security vulnerabilities, see [GitHub's documentation on privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports with the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Vulnerability Fix**: Timeline will vary based on severity and complexity

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Code Security
- All code changes undergo security review during PR process
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Automated security scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Code signing for all releases

### Data Security
- No personal data is collected or stored
- All algorithm computations are performed client-side
- No external API calls with sensitive data
- Local storage usage is minimal and contains no sensitive information

### Browser Security
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- HTTPS-only access
- Secure cookie configuration
- XSS protection headers
- CORS policy implementation

## 🔄 Version Support

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Code Review**
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Review for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use safe methods for data handling

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories
   - Use only trusted packages
   - Regular audit of package.json

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests
   - Perform penetration testing
   - Regular vulnerability scanning
   - Test edge cases thoroughly

### For Users
1. **Browser Security**
   - Use modern, updated browsers
   - Enable security features
   - Be cautious with browser extensions
   - Report suspicious behavior

2. **Data Safety**
   - Don't input sensitive data
   - Clear browser cache if needed
   - Use private browsing when preferred
   - Be aware of data handling practices

## 🔐 Security Features

### Current Implementation
