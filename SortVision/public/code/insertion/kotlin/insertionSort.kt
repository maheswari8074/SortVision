/**
 * Insertion Sort Algorithm Implementation in Kotlin
 * 
 * Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array
 * one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced
 * algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. Start with the second element (index 1) and compare it with the first element
 * 2. If the second element is smaller, swap them
 * 3. Move to the third element and insert it into the correct position among the
 *    first three elements
 * 4. Continue this process for all elements
 * 5. At each step, the left portion of the array is sorted
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n) - when array is already sorted
 * - Average Case: O(n²) - when array is randomly ordered
 * - Worst Case: O(n²) - when array is sorted in reverse order
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place sorting algorithm
 * 
 * Advantages:
 * - Simple to understand and implement
 * - Efficient for small data sets
 * - Adaptive: if the array is already sorted, it runs in O(n) time
 * - Stable: maintains relative order of equal elements
 * - In-place: requires only O(1) additional memory space
 * 
 * Disadvantages:
 * - Inefficient for large data sets
 * - Generally performs worse than advanced algorithms like quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort
