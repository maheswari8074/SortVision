      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions - Sorting Algorithms & DSA Learning</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>What is the best sorting algorithm to learn first?</h3>
        <p>For beginners, we recommend starting with Bubble Sort to understand basic comparison and swapping concepts, then progressing to Insertion Sort and Selection Sort before tackling more advanced algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.</p>
        
        <h3>How do I prepare for sorting algorithm interview questions?</h3>
        <p>Practice implementing each algorithm from scratch, understand their time and space complexities, know when to use each algorithm, and be able to modify them for specific requirements. Our visualizer helps you understand the mechanics before coding.</p>
        
        <h3>What's the difference between stable and unstable sorting algorithms?</h3>
        <p>Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of equal elements, while unstable algorithms may change their relative positions. Merge Sort and Insertion Sort are stable, while Quick Sort and Heap Sort are typically unstable.</p>
        
        <h3>Which sorting algorithm is most efficient?</h3>
        <p>It depends on your data and constraints. Merge Sort and Heap Sort guarantee O(n log n) worst-case performance, Quick Sort averages O(n log n) but can degrade to O(n²), while Radix Sort can be O(nk) for integer data.</p>
