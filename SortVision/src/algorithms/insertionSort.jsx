/**
 * Insertion Sort Algorithm
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n) - when array is already sorted
 * - Average Case: O(n²)
 * - Worst Case: O(n²)
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place sorting
 * 
 * Description:
 * Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array
 * one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced
 * algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, it performs well
 * for small lists and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms.
